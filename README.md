# CypressYt Learning
This repository contains my learning path that I used for demonstrate on YouTube.

## Prerequisite
You should have node installed in your machine. Make sure to checkout [cypress website](https://docs.cypress.io/app/get-started/install-cypress) for specific requirements on node and npm versions.

This section covers information about project set-up and cypress installation.

npm init
```

2. Install cypress

```

3. Open Cypress Launchpad
